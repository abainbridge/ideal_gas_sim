<h1>2D ideal gas simulation of 40,000 particles.</h1>
<p>
Initially all particles have the same velocity but after a few seconds of
collisions, their directions are randomized and their speeds follow the
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. A histogram of the speeds is shown in the
bottom left.
</p>
<p>
You can also see wave-front propagation happening at the "speed of sound".
